        <strong>These Three Things</strong> is a Jesus-centred think-tank and fund that 
        exists to see the church, and itâ€™s people, flourish. As well as commissioning 
        thought-leading Christian writing and research, and providing financial backing 
        to projects that we believe will bless the Church and, hopefully, the whole world, 
        we are also a platform for voices otherwise unheard, and a network for ideas 
        otherwise adrift. Use the links below to find our more about what we do.
