            <strong>These Three Things</strong> is a Jesus-centred think-tank and fund that
            exists to see the church, and itâ€™s people, flourish. As well as commissioning
            thought-leading Christian writing and research, and providing financial backing
            to projects that we believe will bless the Church and, hopefully, the whole world,
            we are also a platform for voices otherwise unheard, and a network for ideas
            otherwise adrift. Use the links below to find our more about what we do.
